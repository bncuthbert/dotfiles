## Dotfiles
Dotfiles are managed by [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) as described [here](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

For now, these are mostly modifications to the default dotfiles provided by [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/), and contain many system-specific configuration options.
